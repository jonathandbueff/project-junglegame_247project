## A board game

User Story (Iteration 1):
  Two players run the code, then a 9*7 board, with lands, rivers, traps, and dens, shows up on the screen. Each player has 8 pieces located on the board: an elephant, a lion, a tiger, a leopard, a wolf, a dog, a cat, and a mouse, from the strongest to the weakest. Each animal of one player can capture the opponent's animals that are not stronger than it, with the exception that a mouse can capture an elephant. Two players play in turn, moving one piece to a box next to its original location. Mouses can walk, but cannot attack elephants, in the river. Lions and tigers can jump accross the river as long as there is no mouse in between. When a animal is trapped, it can be captured by any piece of the opponent. One player wins if she gets to the den of the opponent.
User Story (Iteration 2):
  Players have a menu to choose modes, move back, replay, and so on.
  Each move is recorded on a page next to the board.
  A player loses if all pieces are gone.
